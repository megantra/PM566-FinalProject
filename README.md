PM566 Final Project - Rates of Contraceptive Use For Women of Different Age Groups

Megan Tran


Project Description: Research shows that LARC contraceptives are more effective forms of birth control than M/M methods and are safe for women of all ages to use. LARC methods could prevent more cases of teenage pregnancy for young women at risk and who are sexually active. However, M/M methods are more widely used and may be perceived by the public to be safer since they don't require surgical insertions of long-term devices into the body. Young women with inadequate knowledge about sex education and reproductive health may not have enough information about the different available contraceptive methods and as a result, be unable to make an informed decision on the contraceptive type that's right for them.

The research question being explored is if younger women (age 15-20) use long-acting reversible methods of contraception (LARC) at a lower rate than older women (age 21-44) and is that trend consistent throughout the three year period?
